	  <h2 id="2">What are Windows errors?</h2>
<p>A Windows error is an error that happens when an unexpected condition occurs or when a desired operation has failed. When you have an error in Windows -- whether it's Windows 7, Windows XP or Windows Vista -- it may be critical and cause your programs to freeze and crash or it may be seemingly harmless yet annoying. Left unchecked, your system will become increasingly unstable, run more slowly and crash more frequently. You may be left unable to run programs at all.</p>
		<p>The procedures necessary to correct Windows errors differ from one case to another. You could try a do it yourself or DIY method to fix Windows errors. This requires that you research the exact error message that's listed on the error pop-up window. But what if it's a virus causing this Windows error? Or what if your search doesn't turn up any fixes? If you manage to find the fix, it's something best done by professional technicians or a professional Windows Repair program.</p>
		<p>The recommended solution is to use the Reimage professional Windows system repair software which runs a deep scan of your Windows system, finds and automatically fixes system files and components that are causing those Windows errors. Reimage is the only program that has over 25,000,000 files in a repository and actually fixes your corrupted, malfunctioning and missing Windows software files. Run Reimage repair now to get a free PC report to see what PC problems you have and also get a free spyware and virus scan.</p>
		<p>Reimage increases performance, stops computer freezing and system crashes as well as improves overall PC stability. With regular use, Reimage will constantly refresh your operating system, which keeps your computer running at its best. Reimage is a fast, easy and safe solution to fixing Windows errors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="3">What are the different types of errors?</h2>

<p>Windows may be caused by windows system files damage. The corrupted system files entries can be a real threat to the well being of your computer. </p>
<h3>Blue Screens AKA Blue Screen of Death</h3>
		<p>A <strong>stop error screen</strong> or <strong>bug check screen</strong>, commonly called a <strong>Blue Screen of Death</strong> (also <strong>BSoD</strong>, <strong>bluescreen</strong>), is caused by a fatal system error and is the error screen displayed by the Microsoft Windows family of Operating Systems upon encountering a critical error, of a non-recoverable nature, that causes the system to &quot;crash.&quot; Stop errors are usually hardware or driver related, causing the computer to stop responding. Bluescreens are typically caused by unsuspected software errors in device drivers.</p>
		<h3>How to fix Blue Screen of Death?</h3>
		<p>You could try a do it yourself or DIY method to fix Blue Screen errors. This requires that you research the exact error message that's listed on the Blue Screen. However, what if it's a virus causing the blue screen error? Or what if your search doesn't turn up any fixes? If you manage to find the fix, it's something best done by professional technicians or a professional PC Repair program. You can spend countless hours trying to figure out how to repair your Blue Screen error but wouldn't it save time to have an automatic program do it?<br />
		  <br />
		  One solution is to use the Reimage professional Windows system repair software which runs a deep scan of your Windows system, finds and automatically fixes system software problems that are causing those Blue Screens.<br />
		  <br />
		  Reimage is the only program that has over 25,000,000 files in a repository and actually fixes your corrupted, malfunctioning and missing Windows software files. Run a scan with a <a href="../../download.php">program like Reimage</a> to get a free PC report to see what PC problems you have and also get a free spyware and virus scan. In case you have an hardware problem the scan will detect it and inform you.<br />
		  <br />
	    Reimage also increases performance, stops computer freezing and system crashes as well as improves overall PC stability. With regular use, Reimage will constantly refresh your Operating System which will keep your computer running at its best. Reimage is a fast, easy and safe solution to fixing Blue Screens and all other Windows errors.</p>

		<h3>DLL Errors</h3>
		<p>A DLL error is the most common Windows error. You've likely had a message pop up, at least once or twice, informing you that a DLL error has occurred. If you're like a lot of people, you probably shut your computer down and rebooted, hoping the problem had gone away. But, what exactly is a DLL error, and how does it affect your computer?</p>
		<p>DLL stands for Dynamic Link Library. Essentially, a DLL file is a necessary component of a particular program or application. Without that DLL file, the program or application cannot run properly. Some DLL files are shared by numerous programs, and if a particular DLL file becomes corrupted or is accidentally deleted, it could wreak havoc on how those programs, that are associated with it, are run.</p>
		<p><strong>Missing DLL</strong> - this means that a call has been made by an application for a particular DLL. However, that DLL could not be found. In some cases this means that the DLL file in questions cannot be found on your system. However, when a DLL is called, the application must provide a path to that library.</p>
		<p>A missing DLL error can occur in cases where the actual DLL name does not match the name of the DLL being called. It may also mean that the path being called does not match the actual path of the existing DLL. The DLL may be on your system, but it is possible that it could have an incorrect name or be in the incorrect location. This could be an error with the DLL itself or with the coding of the application causing the error.</p>
		<p><strong>Corrupt DLL</strong> - a DLL, like any other file or folder on your computer, can become corrupt. They become corrupt for one of a number of reasons. Spyware or virus infections can certainly lead to a number of important files on your system becoming corrupt. If you have manually attempted to alter the contents of a file, then this too can lead to a corruption. An interrupted installation or even an interrupted execution of the DLL may also lead to a corrupt DLL error message.</p>
        <h3>Reimage and Windows DLL Errors</h3>
        <p>Sure, you can spend countless hours trying to figure out how to repair your DLL error but wouldn't it save time to have an automatic program do it?</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Reimage will replace your missing/damaged DLL files with fresh, clean and up-to-date ones</li>
          <li>Reimage will replace ALL DLL files* that are missing and/or damaged - Even those you don't know about!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Freezing Computer</h3>
        <p><strong>Computer hanging</strong> or <strong>freezing</strong> occurs when either a program or the whole Operating System ceases to respond to inputs. In the most commonly encountered scenario, a program freezes and all windows belonging to the frozen program become static, and though the mouse cursor still moves on the screen, neither typing on the keyboard nor clicking the mouse produces any effect in the program's windows. The mouse cursor may also be stuck in a form indicating that it is waiting for some operation to complete, such as an hourglass or a spinning wait cursor. Almost always, the only way to recover from a system freeze is to reboot the machine, usually by power cycling with an on/off or reset button.</p>

        <h3>What Causes my Windows to Freeze?</h3>
        <p>The most common but least severe cause of your computer screen freezing is when your system is using all RAM (memory) available - at that particular moment. If so, you've got a hardware problem. Our free Reimage scan can tell you how your PC's RAM compares to a worldwide average. <a href="../../download.php">Find out how</a> your PC's hardware ranks, in under 5 minutes.</p>
        <h3>How to Fix &quot;Computer Screen Freeze&quot;</h3>
        <h3>Simple Fixes</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>This problem might be temporary. Wait a few moments to see if everything starts functioning again.</li>
          <li>Either increase your RAM or start closing programs that are running in the foreground and background of your computer that you don't need. Follow the following steps:
            <ol>
              <li>Press the 'Alt', 'Ctrl' and 'Del' buttons all at the same time, and you should bring up Windows Task Manager.</li>
              <li>See if any programs show up in the 'Applications' window as not being responsive.</li>
              <li>If anything shows, highlight it and click 'End Task'.</li>
              <li>Wait a few seconds, and the non-responsive programs should shut down.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>More Complicated Fixes</h3>
        <p>If the problem isn't a purely short term, temporary one, then it's something more serious.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Fire up your trusty anti-virus program and run a full virus scan now. If you don't have anti-virus software already, you can download the program from MacAfee, or use <a href="../../download.php">Reimage's</a> free scan to diagnose malware.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>An Automatic Solution</h3>
        <p>The recommended solution is to use the professional Windows system repair software which runs a deep scan of your Windows system, finds and automatically fixes system software problems that are causing your computer to freeze. Reimage is the only program that has over 25,000,000 files in a repository and actually fixes your corrupted, malfunctioning and missing Windows software files. <a href="../../download.php">Run Reimage scan</a> to get a free PC report to see what PC problems you have and also get a free spyware and virus scan.<br />
          <br />
          Reimage also increases performance, stops computer freezing and system crashes as well as improves overall PC stability. With regular use, Reimage will constantly refresh your operating system which will keep your computer running at its best. Reimage is a fast, easy and safe solution to fixing PC freeze and all other Windows problems.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Virus Damage</h3>
<p>Once your computer has been infected with a virus, it's no longer the same. After removing it with your anti-virus software, you're often left with lingering side-effects. The symptoms vary, but the bottom line is the same: Your computer doesn't work the way it used to. Your favorite programs crash frequently, your registry entries are a mess and even your wallpaper is mysteriously missing.</p>
<p>Why did this happen? You've already removed the virus. Shouldn't the havoc it caused go away, along with it? What about the damage caused to your system? Isn't it simply erased, along with the malware that caused it?</p>
<p><strong>Technically, your computer might no longer be infected, but that doesn't mean it's error-free. Simple removing a virus can actually harm your system.</strong></p>
<h3>Invisible Virus Damage</h3>
<p>Many Trojans and viruses do not advertise their presence on your computer. Viruses can surreptitiously infiltrate your PC, and both the files and the system will remain operable. Trojans can hide themselves in and secretly corrupt your PC without you suspecting anything is wrong.</p>
<p>This is the reason an antivirus program is so essential.</p>
<h3>Anti-virus Programs and Reimage</h3>
<p>Reimage is a complementary solution to your anti-virus software. Your anti-virus software is there to detect new threats, terminate them and constantly protect your PC while Reimage is there to heal the damage these viruses have already caused.</p>
<p><strong>That's why a full system scan of your entire hard drive with a good anti-virus program is always recommended after a Reimage repair.</strong></p>
<h3>Reimage Gets Rid of Virus Damage</h3>
<p>Reimage uses a number of different virus engines simultaneously  and a custom virus engine, developed by our R&amp;D team. We use white lists together with black lists to better detect what should and should not reside in your operating system. This allows us to pinpoint and exterminate harmful components.<br />
  The Reimage repair automatically compares system files with the Reimage repository files. Infected files are easily pointed out and then replaced with healthy ones. Infected files locked by viruses or by your operating system will be replaced when you reboot your PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Operating System Recovery</h3>
<p>A clean reinstallation of Windows is often the only solution when your computer gets too congested to work anymore. However, a thorough reinstall of the Operating System is a time-consuming task that involves lengthy back-ups, long installations, and days to find and reinstall all of your favorite programs.</p>
<p><strong><a href="../../download.php">Reimage</a> is the best alternative</strong> to that long, unnecessary process. You can reduce your computer's idle time and reinstall the Windows Operating System, without resorting to an unnecessary and often risky technique that's best left to professional technicians.</p>
<p>The Reimage process <strong>saves you the time and hassle</strong> of having to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Download endless registry cleaners and system optimizers that simply don't work</li>
  <li>Figure out if you have a virus</li>
  <li>Find your Windows installation CD and realize it is outdated or scratched</li>
  <li>Reinstall Windows and actually &quot;start from scratch&quot;</li>
  <li>Reinstall broken drivers, software applications, recover license keys and passwords</li>
</ol>
<p>In most cases, it means you will never need to reinstall Windows again.</p>
<p>One download, a few clicks, and the software will refresh your entire Windows PC.</p>
<p>Reimage will revive your entire system, leaving it error-free and stable, safely and securely.</p>
<p>One click &amp; a free <a href="../../download.php">scan</a> gets you started.</p>
